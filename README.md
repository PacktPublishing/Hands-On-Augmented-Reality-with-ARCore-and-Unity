## About the Video Course
With an increase in the number of customers using mobile for interactive gaming, 3D presentation and conferences augmented reality is gaining popularity in the market. ARCore is provided by Google, which makes ARCore a trump card for every Unity developer to get into the Android.

In this course, you’ll understand the fundamentals of ARCore such as motion tracking, environmental detection, image recognition, and light estimation. You’ll also learn to utilize this framework to build your own mobile AR applications with Unity. You’ll start by creating a new project and install all the necessary tools to manage, debug, and develop your application.

By the end of this course, you’ll not only have created multiple AR applications, but you’ll also have all the knowledge to develop your own engaging experiences with ARCore in Unity.
